tbd attemps to emulate the human ability to calculate rough averages of tricky data sets. It primitively deliberates by first calculating the 'dirty' average of X product, including all scams/flukes/what-have-you. Then, the listing w/ the greatest digression from this mean is tossed, and the average is taken again. this repeats until each no one price deviates greater than X percent from any other price.
